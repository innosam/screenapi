###Automate GNU screens with simple yet useful API's###

`screenapi` is python module which provides screen API's to automate our task of creating local setups.  It.s simple set of 3 API.s that can save time spent on bringing up setups.

Have included a sample script.

I hope you guys find it useful.  

###Requirements?###

1> Run the scripts with python2.4 or above. 
2> Ofcourse gnu screen    

###What is in for me?###

It basically provides API's to

            1>  create_screen(sname)
                  create screen

            2> create_window(sname, windowname)
                  create window in the screen

            3>  run_cmd_screen(sname, id, command)
                  run command over a particular window of a screen

###How can i make my scripts?###


Run Sample Script and figure out
            
            python2.4 screenApiTest.py 

###What if i find bugs/issues?###

   1> Get your hands on the library provided `screenapi/screenapi.py`
